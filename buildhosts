#
# buildhosts - Build and maintain /etc/hosts while including lists
#              imported from local and remote hosts list sources
#
# Instructions (as root):
#
# Enable Remote Sources
#   1. The first time you run the 'build' command, /etc/hosts will be
#      moved to /etc/hosts.core, and the file /etc/hosts.sources will
#      be created using the default sources list. The /etc/hosts file
#      will then be generated by combining /etc/hosts.core and the
#      resulting contents of downloaded sources in /etc/hosts.sources.
#   2. You can now open /etc/hosts.sources and remove or comment out
#      (by adding # in front) any sources you don't wish to use, as
#      well as add new ones. Sources can remote as well as local.
#   3. If you want to make any changes to the contents of what used to
#      be /etc/hosts, you should now make them to /etc/hosts.core, and
#      you'll need to rerun the 'build' command to have them applied.
#   4. Once you're done customizing your configuration, run the 'build'
#      command again and the /etc/hosts file will be regenerated using
#      the current list of sources and your up-to-date /etc/hosts.core
#      file.
#
# Disable Remote Sources
#   1. To disable the configured hosts lists, run the 'revert' command
#      and /etc/hosts.core will be moved back to /etc/hosts.
#   *  The /etc/hosts.sources file will continue to exist until it's
#      manually deleted, and it will be used again the next time remote
#      sources are enabled.
#
# Notes on /etc/hosts.sources
#   * On each line of /etc/hosts.sources, after # is commented/skipped.
#   * Colour output can be disabled by setting the variable NOCOL=1.
#   * The $HOSTS_SYSTEM variable can be set to an alternative location
#     to configure a different file to be used for /etc/hosts.
#   * Similarly, the $HOSTS_CORE and $HOSTS_SOURCES variables (which
#     default to $HOSTS_SYSTEM.core and $HOSTS_SYSTEM.sources and will
#     automatically change if $HOSTS_SYSTEM is changed), can be set to
#     alternative locations to configure the use of different files.
